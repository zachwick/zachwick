**instructional designer, software engineer, local government legislator, and perpetual student**

Howdy! I am an aspiring polymath who likes to work on problems at the intersection of tech, law, and education. I am a former software engineer turned instructional designer and also work as an elected legislator for The Village of Carey, Ohio. I'm currently simultaneously working on an MBA in Accounting and an MEd in Instructional Design and working as a developer advocate at @renderinc.

## Who am I?
Hailing from the midwest, I spent a decade working as a software engineer building things from custom automotive hardware and firmware to full-stack software and educational efforts such as the [Stripe Partner Program](https://stripe.com/partners).

Now, I am pursuing two graduate degrees simultaneously and narrowing my focus to problems at the intersection of technology, law, and education.

## What am I interested in?
I enjoying thinking about developer enablement and education through the lens of instructional design. I think that developer enablement can and should be more than just an API reference thrown together haphazardly after the coding and building is done. I think that when fully executed developer enablement can be a series of educational experiences that empower and enable users to get the most value out of a piece of software and guide them to a deeper understanding of how to use a particular software solution to its limit.


Aquaponics, and more generally indoor food crop production, fascinates me. I think that the increased need for foodstuffs and the adverse effects of human-induced climate change have created an environment where indoor food crop production is quickly becoming a booming field of exploration and rife for advancement (pun intended!).

I also enjoy thinking about programming languages as notational forms of spoken human languages. I find it fascinating to look at programming languages such as [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language), [Catala](https://catala-lang.org/), and others from a language pedagogy point-of-view and use tools from linguistic studies to analyze programming languages.

## What do I want to learn?
I want to learn more about automating indoor food crop production and aquaponic growing operations.

I want to learn more about localized and global financial systems and how they've historically excluded large swaths of people.

I want to learn about how humans have historically used technology to increase knowledge dissemination and what can be re-applied to contemporary society for the betterment of all.
